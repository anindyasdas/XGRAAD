# Unmasking Backdoors: An Explainable Defense via Gradient–Attention Anomaly Scoring for Pre-trained Language Models

> **Unmasking Backdoors: An Explainable Defense via Gradient–Attention Anomaly Scoring for Pre-trained Language Models**

**X-GRAAD** introduces an inference-time defense that detects and mitigates backdoor attacks in pre-trained NLP models by computing anomaly scores from token-level attention and gradient signals. These signals highlight trigger tokens that dominate the model’s internal behavior.

The method reduces attack success rates across diverse backdoor scenarios while also providing interpretable insights into trigger localization and defense effectiveness.

## 📦 Dependencies

X-GRAAD is implemented and tested under the following environment:

```
Python 3.9
CUDA: 13.0
NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠 Preparation

### Model Directory Structure

Trained backdoored models should be placed in the following directory structure:

```
trained_models1/
├── BADNLI/
│   ├── SST/
│   ├── AGNews/
│   ├── IMDb/
├── RIPPLES/
│   ├── SST/
```

> **Note:** Trained models are not included in this repository.  
> Please download or generate the poisoned models and place them in the above directory structure.

## 🧪 Backdoor Attacks

All backdoor attacks are implemented using the open-source toolkit  
[OpenBackdoor](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenBackdoor).

### Supported Attacks

- **BADNLI (BadNets)**
- **RIPPLES**
- **LWS**

---

## 🛡 Defense: X-GRAAD Framework

### Detection & Defense Module

This module identifies poisoned inputs by computing anomaly scores derived from gradient and attention signals, followed by threshold-based filtering.

### Example Usage

```bash
python x_graad.py \
    --model_name bert \
    --ds_name sst \
    --attack_name BADNLI \
    --threshold_percentile 95 \
    --trigger_id 0
```
